# Hardware Assignments
Most objects related to hardware (motor controllers, driver controller, sensors, etc.) should be done in the `Hardware.java` class.
The only exceptions should be Swerve Drive related due to their relation to the set of classes in the `robot.utils.swerve` folder.

The associated ID's and such should also be put as comments at the top of the `Hardware.java` class for future reference.
